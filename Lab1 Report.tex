\title{Abstract}
\\ \\
In this lab, students were given a TowerPro MG995 DIGIHI-Speed Servo Motor and told to make it move using the function generator. To perform this task, students made use of lab equipment such as the function generator, DC power supply, and oscilloscope to characterize the servo motor provided. The circuit was built using the Cadet power supply and breadboard.
